Notes from my trip to Maui during Summer 2018

## Hiking/Nature

### Mount Haleakala
+ $25 per car, valid for three days after purchase (but rounded down to the nearest midnight).
+ Very long and possibly difficult drive if htere is fog or water on the road
+ Even on raint days, the view from the top of the mountain is clear
+ The best spot to see the volcano crater is a few miles down the road from the summit. There is a large pulloff area that has the best views of the inside of the crater, as well as views of the island. Stargazing tours usually stop here as well.
+ The summit is extremely cold and windy at night. Parking is very difficult at sunset, and it is permit-only at sunrise

### Ahihi-Kinau Lava fields
+ Large lava field near Kihei, a long walk but worthwhile
+ Wear cushioned shoes, the lava rocks are coarse and difficult to walk on

### Oneuli Black Sand Beach
+ There is a public access to this beach, but it is very hidden. There is a shallow indentation on the east side of the road, and an access road opposite it on the west side.

### Acid War Zone / Olivine pools / Dragon Teeth / Blowhole
+ We did not visit this string of sites on the north side of the island, but they apparently rival many sites along the Road to Hana, but with substantially less driving.

## Snorkeling

We rented from Snorkel Bob's, which has locations throughout the islands. They allow you to return after-hours, and even to different locations (even on different islands). We went for the "split" snorkel package with a "bubba" dry snorkel, rather than the more elaborate "two tube" snorkel package, and we were happy with the snorkels

Black rock beach, near the north end of the island, is extremely busy (it is located right next to a resort). however, it it had many sea turtles in the water and a small coral reef.

Ahihi Kinau Cove, near the south end of the island, is a small cove accessible along the main road that had very few people and an incredibly large coral reef beneath it. The diversity of fish visible here was amazing---we saw eels, flounder, very large angelfish, and several pufferfish types. Strangely, we noticed that the fish here were much larger than the fish we saw at other snorkeling locations.
+ There are other coves along this road, but they have heavy waves in the afternoon and thus might not be safe.

Kamaole Beach 1 and 2 are highly recommended as well, but we found that it was too windy to try these places


## Road to Hana

Overall, we thought this was a bit overrated. We left by 7:30 AM and proceeded the full length of the road to the Kipahulu pools, and we were not back until around 7 pm. Overall, a very intense day with only some stops and view along the way being worth it.
An extremely good app that we used to navigate the road and lean about the best spots is [here](https://gypsyguide.com/tour/road-to-hana-maui/)

Stops along the route:

Waikamoi Ridge Trail
+ A very beautiful and not very busy loop through the roots of a tree system, which enters a bamboo forest and overlooks the Pacific Ocean at its highest point

Kaumahina State Wayside Park

Keanae Arboretum
+ This is a very popular spot on the road, with a very nice variety of trees including beautiful rainbow eucalyptus trees and ponds where taro is grown

Hana Lava Tube
+ This is technically a paid roadside attraction, but it is only $25 for two people
+ This is a long lava tube that is essentially a cave that you visit via a self-guided tour with flashlights. This was easily one of my favorite (and unexpected) things in Maui. 
+ The cave has really unique organisms like blind crickets and a planarian species that "rappels" down from the ceiling, and it is not particularly busy

Waiâ€™anapanapa State Park
+ Very crowded park, with a black sand beach that was almost entirely covered with tourists
+ A nice place to see mongooses, feral cats, and a wide variety of native birds

Koki Beach
+ A less-busy beach slightly off the main road, with unique lava rock formations and a view back of the eastern coast of Maui

Wailua Falls was very crowded, but nonetheless a very beautiful stopping point

Seven Sacred Pools at Kipahulu
+ These pools may not be entered, but they are nonetheless beautiful and are accompanied by a striking black sands beach
+ There is a well-reviewed trail, the Pipiwai trail, that passes all of the pools on a five mile loop. We did not do this entire trail.
+ You must pay the Healeakala National Park entry fee ($25) to visit this. If you have entered the park at another location within the past three days (such as at the summit), then you do not need to pay again.

Charles Lindbergh's grave
+ This is an easy-to-miss left turn towards a church almost immediately after leaving Kipahulu pools / Haleakala national park
+ This is a very quiet spot that was a great way to end the road to Haleakala

## Restaurants

Komoda Store and Bakery
+ Malasadas and other fresh pastries upcountry on Mount Haleakala

Tin Roof (near the airport) for octopus poke and other interesting dishes

Da Kitchen (Kihei) for various staple dishes, such as pulled pork, loco moco, and other grilled dishes. Others recommend the frend spam musubi, but they sell out of this early.

Paia Fish company (Kihei). Fresh alamari and the grilled moonfish (Opah). Busy at night, but can order ahead over the phone.

Nalu's South Shore Grill has a "black and blue" eggs benedict with grilled Ahi tuna

Happy Maid (Kihei) for cream-filled malasadas

Eskimo Candy has very good poke, which can be picked up to-go in half-pound increments. Most of their poke is tuna based.

Kihei Caffe has good breakfast burritos

Cuatro is a nice sit-down retaurant in Kihei with really good fish dishes.

Leoda's pie shop (near Lahaina) has a reputation for having very good small pies. We tried their chocolate macadamia nut pie.
