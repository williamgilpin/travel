Personal notes from my trip to Tokyo in October, 2016

### Preparation for departure

+ Alert bank/credit vendors that I will be in Japan and using debit/credit cards
+ A power plug adapter is not necessary.
+ Set a 4 digit PIN on debit card to ensure that it will work on international ATM
+ When using credit card abroad, always pay in the local currency and let your bank convert it later.
+ When using debit card abroad, you may need to select for it to be processed as "credit," even at an ATM
+ Roaming data is expensive, so go into your phone's "Cellular" settings and disable cellular data usage for apps---some third party apps sip data in the background.
+ Obtain several color copies of your passport information

### Arrival

The Narita Express or the Keisei Skyliner are the two trains from the airport. I used the former because it goes directly to Shinjuku station.

When I went, you could buy a round-trip ticket on the Narita Express as long as you planned on returning within two weeks of the first purchase. The seat from the airport was reserved on a specific car and a specific train, but the return ticket does not have a specifc date or train on it---you just have to use it within two weeks. On the return trip, you need to go to the JR East Travel Services desk at any station in Tokyo in order to exchange the ticket for a specific reservation---they do not accept the original return ticket itself.

After arriving at Shinjuku, transfer to whichever JR line takes you to your stop (I took the Chuo line to Nakano). Your Narita Express ticket will allow you to exit the station (it includes the cost of the trip to your destination as long as it is on a JR line)

After arriving at your destination, get a Suica card from a kiosk. The card will cost a 500 JPY deposit

Nakano SunPlaza: use the side revolving door to enter after 10 pm
Lobby on the 16th floor, take first elevator to lobby, then there's a separate elevator on that floor that goes into the hotel.

### Departure

I exchanged cash after clearing security---there is one location to do this on the airside of the terminal. I lost about 4% to the broker on the transation, which is better than the exchange rates for the US brokers

Most of the cafes in the terminal accept standard credit cards, so you can eat after exchanging currency
