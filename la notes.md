Trip to LA during spring 2018

## Getting around

I could not figure out the best way to get from the airport to LA downtown. I tried taking Lyft, but it took an incredibly long time to hail one (around 45 minutes). I assume that locals must use a public transit or shuttle service, but I was not able to figure out what this is.

I found that Uber was consistently faster than Lyft in the downtown LA area, for reasons that I was unable to determine.

## Attractions


The Getty Museum took 1.5 hours to enter on a Saturday due to traffic at the entrance and parking garage.

The contemporary art museum (MOCA) is incredible, and offers reciprocal benefits with several other California museums
