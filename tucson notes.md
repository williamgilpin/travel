### Gates Pass


The absolute best place to view Saguaro cacti in Tucson --- better than the National Park. If you only visit one place in Tucson, Gates Pass and the accompanying drive are absolutely worth it


### Sonoran Desert Museum

An incredible zoo. Animal habitats were creative, and we could get surprisingly close to the animals.

# Restuarants

Zemam's is possibly the best Ethiopian restaurant I have ever been to.
