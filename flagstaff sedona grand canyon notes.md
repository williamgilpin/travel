# Grand Canyon (South Rim)

After coming in the main entrance, ignore the materials urging you to park and take a shuttle bus. If you drive about 5 minutes to the east, away from the tourist sites, the crowd density decreases substantially.

The best hike we found was the "Shoshone trail," a 1 mile hike that leads to a stunning lookout point with a 270 degree panoramic view.



# Sedona


### Cathedral Rock Trailhead

This is the best trail we found in Sedona, with the best views and best access. The full trail requires some mild climbing, but is relatively safe and well-marked. However, for the best views one only needs to go about halfway up the trail, past the first major mesa.

### Red Rock State Park

We did not think that this park was worth seeing. It is expensive to park, and has obstructed and distant views of the rock formations.

### Airport Vista / Lookout point

Past the cattle guard, there is a small trail that leads to another site below the lookout point. It is about 1/4 - 1/3 of a mile walk, but it takes you away from the tourists and trees that obstruct the view from the main lookout.

### Slide rock park

We did not stop here, but it was highly recommended---if we had more time we would have come here.


# Flagstaff

We ran out of time, but we would have liked to do some astrophotography near the Lowell Observatory, Sunset Volcanic Crater, and Wapatki park (native american ruins)

If we had another day, we may have tried to drive to the meteor crater that is also nearby

Bearizona, a wildlife park near Flagstaff, was a highlight of our trip. It features live wolves and bears that literally walk up to cars as they drive through
