# Attractions


### Hoover Dam

We went at night (very close to closing), at which time there are basically no tourists left. At night, the entire structure is illuminated with spotlights.

### Palms Hotel and Casino

The art collection here is extensive, featuring a Warhol (hidden behind a bar in a high roller room) and a variety of modern and contemporary artists. A centerpiece of the casino is a bar featuring a giant shark cadaver (a piece by Damian Hirst), as well as a huge collection of Hirst's spot paintings

### Pinball hall of fame

+ No fee to enter, and most games are 50 cents to play. They have a variety of working games, spanning from 1920s era pinball tables to an original Donkey Kong arcade game. 
+ Plenty of (free) parking
+ They have a 60s(?) era machine that performs a custom injection molding of a Disney character. 

### Fremont district

The main area here caters very heavily to tourists. Very similar to Times Square, with costumes and ziplines and large chain restaurants

There is a speakeasy called "The Underground" in the basement of the nearby Mob Museum that is worth visiting. The password was posted on their Instagram account.


### East Fremont district

An arts district within walking distance of the more tourist-facing main Fremont district. Highlights include a giant metal grasshopper that shoots flames in tune with music, as well as "Atomic Liquors," which is possibly Vegas' oldest bar (and which has a rotating variety of craft cocktails)

### Henderson

This area is basically contiguous with LV proper, and it has many excellent Japanese and Korean restaurants, as well as a few local taquerias.



# Hotels


We stayed at the Mandalay Bay. If we returned, I would probably want to stay off-strip. The Mandalay Bay was awful (despite a four-star rating and high online reviews), and many of the other strip hotels appear to have similar problems. The Mandalay Bay also has a bad location.
